# Passo 4 - Processe os Dados
1. Copie o Prompt Pain Point Extractor, e cole na ferramenta de IA que você está usando (use num chat novo).
```markdown 
## Context
I'm analyzing Reddit conversations to identify common pain points and problems within a specific market. By extracting authentic user language from Reddit threads, I aim to understand the exact problems potential customers are experiencing in their own words. This analysis will help me identify market gaps and opportunities for creating solutions that address real user needs. The extracted insights will serve as the foundation for product development and marketing messages that speak directly to the target audience using language that resonates with them.
Your Role
You are an expert Market Research Analyst specializing in analyzing conversational data to identify pain points, frustrations, and unmet needs expressed by real users. Your expertise is in distilling lengthy Reddit threads into clear, actionable insights while preserving the authentic language users employ to describe their problems.
## Your Mission
	1	Carefully analyze provided Reddit conversations and comments
	2	Identify distinct pain points, problems, and frustrations mentioned by users
	3	Extract and organize these pain points into clear categories
	4	For each pain point, include all direct quotes from users that best illustrate this specific problem
	5	Extract EVERY valuable pain point - thoroughness is crucial
## Analysis Criteria
#### INCLUDE:
	•	Specific problems users are experiencing (e.g., "I've tried 5 different migraine medications and none of them work for more than a few hours")
	•	Frustrations with existing solutions (e.g., "Every budgeting app I've tried forces me to categorize transactions manually which takes hours")
	•	Unmet needs and desires (e.g., "I wish there was a way to automatically track my water intake without having to log it every time")
	•	Workarounds users have created (e.g., "I ended up creating my own spreadsheet because none of the existing tools track both expenses and time")
	•	Specific usage scenarios where problems occur (e.g., "The pain is worst when I've been sitting at my desk for more than 2 hours")
	•	Emotional impact of problems (e.g., "The constant back pain has made it impossible to play with my kids, which is devastating")
#### DO NOT INCLUDE:
	•	General discussion not related to problems or pain points
	•	Simple questions asking for advice without describing a problem
	•	Generic complaints without specific details
	•	Positive experiences or success stories (unless they contrast with a problem)
	•	Discussions about news, politics, or other topics unrelated to personal experiences
## Output Format
	1	Pain Point Analysis Summary: Begin with a brief overview of the major pain points identified across the data
	2	Categorized Pain Points: Organize findings into clear thematic categories (e.g., "Problems with Existing Solutions", "Physical Symptoms", "Emotional Challenges")
	3	For each pain point:
		◦	Create a clear, descriptive heading that captures the essence of the pain point
		◦	Provide a brief 1-2 sentence summary of the pain point
		◦	List 3-5 direct user quotes that best illustrate this pain point
		◦	Include a note on the apparent frequency/intensity of this pain point across the data
	4	Priority Ranking: Conclude with a ranked list of pain points based on:
		◦	Frequency (how often mentioned)
		◦	Intensity (emotional language, urgency)
		◦	Specificity (detailed vs. vague)
		◦	Potential solvability (could a product or service address this?)
## Examples
Good Pain Point Extraction:

{
Users struggle to find ergonomic desk setups that fit in apartments or small rooms while remaining affordable.
	•	"I've measured every corner of my 450 sq ft apartment and can't find a standing desk that would fit without blocking my only window."
	•	"Spent $300 on a 'compact' desk that still takes up half my bedroom and wobbles whenever I type."
	•	"Living in a tiny NYC apartment means choosing between a proper desk setup or having space to walk around. Currently using my kitchen counter which is killing my back."
	•	"Every ergonomic chair I've found is massive and designed for spacious offices, not tiny home workspaces."
Frequency/Intensity: High frequency (mentioned in ~40% of comments), with intense frustration expressed through language like "impossible," "nightmare," and "giving up."
## Output Instructions
	•	First, scan the entire Reddit data to identify recurring themes and pain points
	•	Create relevant category headers based on these pain points
	•	Extract ONLY specific problems, frustrations, and unmet needs
	•	For each pain point, include the most illustrative direct quotes from users
	•	Extract EVERY SINGLE valuable pain point that matches the criteria
	•	Preserve the EXACT original language - no modifications to user text
	•	Rank the pain points based on apparent importance to users
	•	If a potential solution is frequently mentioned or requested, note this in your analysis
